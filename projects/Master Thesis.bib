  abstract = {Egocentric human pose estimation aims to estimate human body poses and develop body representations from a first-person camera perspective. It has gained vast popularity in recent years because of its wide range of applications in sectors like XR-technologies, human-computer interaction, and fitness tracking. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no systematic literature review based on the proposed solutions regarding egocentric 3D human pose estimation. To that end, the aim of this survey paper is to provide an extensive overview of the current state of egocentric pose estimation research. In this paper, we categorize and discuss the popular datasets and the different pose estimation models, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of different methods by comparative analysis. This survey can be a valuable resource for both researchers and practitioners in the field, offering insights into key concepts and cutting-edge solutions in egocentric pose estimation, its wide-ranging applications, as well as the open problems with future scope.},

  abstract = {Crows are corvid songbirds that exhibit remarkable cognitive control over their actions, including their vocalizations. They can learn to vocalize on command and the activity of single neurons from the crow's associative telencephalic structure nidopallium caudolaterale (NCL) is correlated with the execution of this vocal and many non-vocal skilled behaviors. However, it remains unknown if specific anatomical adaptations that directly link the crow NCL to any of the nuclei of the crow's ``song system'' exist. To address this issue, we used fluorescent tracers along with histological staining methods (Nissl-, myelin-, and anti tyrosine hydroxylase) to characterize the connectivity of the crow's NCL in relation to its song system nuclei. We found that the NCL sends dense projections into the dorsal intermediate arcopallium (AID) directly adjacent to and engulfing the robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA), which is the telencephalic motor output of the song system. Similarly, we demonstrate dense NCL projections into the striatum surrounding the basal ganglia song nucleus ``area X''. Both of these descending projections mirror the projections of the nidopallial song nucleus HVC (proper name) into RA and area X, with extremely sparse NCL fibers extending into area X. Furthermore, we characterized the distribution of cells projecting from the lateral part of the magnocellular nucleus of the anterior nidopallium (MAN) to NCL. Notably, a separate medial population of MAN cells projects to HVC. These two sets of connections---MAN to NCL and MAN to HVC---run in parallel but do not overlap. Taken together, our findings support the hypothesis that the NCL is part of a ``general motor system'' that parallels the song system but exhibits only minimal monosynaptic interconnections with it.},

Kinetics has two orders of magnitude more data, with 400 human action classes and over 400 clips per class, and is collected from realistic, challenging YouTube videos. We provide an analysis on how current architectures fare on the task of action classification on this dataset and how much performance improves on the smaller benchmark datasets after pre-training on Kinetics. We also introduce a new Two-Stream Inflated 3D ConvNet (I3D) that is based on 2D ConvNet inflation: filters and pooling kernels of very deep image classification ConvNets are expanded into 3D, making it possible to learn seamless spatio-temporal feature extractors from video while leveraging successful ImageNet architecture designs and even their parameters. We show that, after pre-training on Kinetics, I3D models considerably improve upon the state-of-the-art in action classification, reaching 80.9\% on HMDB-51 and 98.0\% on UCF-101.},

However, many analyses of birdsong require time-consuming, manual annotation of its elements, called syllables. Automated methods for annotation have been proposed, but these methods assume that audio can be cleanly segmented into syllables, or they require carefully tuning multiple statistical models. Here, we present TweetyNet: a single neural network model that learns how to segment spectrograms of birdsong into annotated syllables. We show that TweetyNet mitigates limitations of methods that rely on segmented audio. We also show that TweetyNet performs well across multiple individuals from two species of songbirds, Bengalese finches and canaries. Lastly, we demonstrate that using TweetyNet we can accurately annotate very large datasets containing multiple days of song, and that these predicted annotations replicate key findings from behavioral studies. In addition, we provide open-source software to assist other researchers, and a large dataset of annotated canary song that can serve as a benchmark. We conclude that TweetyNet makes it possible to address a wide range of new questions about birdsong.},

To clarify the code for number in this anatomically distinct endbrain area in birds, neuronal responses to a broad range of numerosities were analyzed. We recorded single-neuron activity from the NCL of crows performing a delayed match-to-sample task with visual numerosities as discriminanda. The responses of {$>$}20\% of randomly selected neurons were modulated significantly by numerosities ranging from one to 30 items. Numerosity-selective neurons showed bell-shaped tuning curves with one of the presented numerosities as preferred numerosity regardless of the physical appearance of the items. The resulting labeled-line code exhibited logarithmic compression obeying the Weber--Fechner law for magnitudes. Comparable proportions of selective neurons were found, not only during stimulus presentation, but also in the delay phase, indicating a dominant role of the NCL in numerical working memory. Both during sensory encoding and memorization of numerosities in working memory, NCL activity predicted the crows' number discrimination performance. These neuronal data reveal striking similarities across vertebrate taxa in their code for number despite convergently evolved and anatomically distinct endbrain structures. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Birds are known for their capabilities to process numerical quantity. However, birds lack a six-layered neocortex that enables primates with numerical competence. We aimed to decipher the neuronal code for numerical quantity in the independently and distinctly evolved endbrain of birds. We recorded the activity of neurons in an endbrain association area termed nidopallium caudolaterale (NCL) from crows that assessed and briefly memorized numerosities from one to 30 dots. We report a neuronal code for sensory representation and working memory of numerosities in the crow NCL exhibiting several characteristics that are surprisingly similar to the ones found in primates. Our data suggest a common code for number in two different vertebrate taxa that has evolved based on convergent evolution.},

  abstract = {To deal with the great number of untrimmed videos produced every day, we propose an efficient unsupervised action segmentation method by detecting boundaries, named action boundary detection (ABD). In particular, the proposed method has the following advantages: no training stage and low-latency inference. To detect action boundaries, we estimate the similarities across smoothed frames, which inherently have the properties of internal consistency within actions and external discrepancy across actions. Under this circumstance, we successfully transfer the boundary detection task into the change point detection based on the similarity. Then, non-maximum suppression (NMS) is conducted in local windows to select the smallest points as candidate boundaries. In addition, a clustering algorithm is followed to refine the initial proposals. Moreover, we also extend ABD to the online setting, which enables real-time action segmentation in long untrimmed videos. By evaluating on four challenging datasets, our method achieves stateof-the-art performance. Moreover, thanks to the efficiency of ABD, we achieve the best trade-off between the accuracy and the inference time compared with existing unsupervised approaches.},

  abstract = {Quantitative aspects of the study of animal and human behaviour are increasingly relevant to test hypotheses and find empirical support for them. At the same time, photo and video cameras can store a large number of video recordings and are often used to monitor the subjects remotely. Researchers frequently face the need to code considerable quantities of video recordings with relatively flexible software, often constrained by species-specific options or exact settings. BORIS is a free, open-source and multiplatform standalone program that allows a user-specific coding environment to be set for a computer-based review of previously recorded videos or live observations. Being open to user-specific settings, the program allows a project-based ethogram to be defined that can then be shared with collaborators, or can be imported or modified. Projects created in BORIS can include a list of observations, and each observation may include one or two videos (e.g. simultaneous screening of visual stimuli and the subject being tested; recordings from different sides of an aquarium). Once the user has set an ethogram, including state or point events or both, coding can be performed using previously assigned keys on the computer keyboard. BORIS allows definition of an unlimited number of events (states/point events) and subjects. Once the coding process is completed, the program can extract a time-budget or single or grouped observations automatically and present an at-a-glance summary of the main behavioural features. The observation data and time-budget analysis can be exported in many common formats (TSV, CSV, ODF, XLS, SQL and JSON). The observed events can be plotted and exported in various graphic formats (SVG, PNG, JPG, TIFF, EPS and PDF).},

To provide a link from poses to actions and their kinematics, we developed B-SOiD -~an open-source, unsupervised algorithm that identifies behavior without user bias. By training a machine classifier on pose pattern statistics clustered using new methods, our approach achieves greatly improved processing speed and the ability to generalize across subjects or labs. Using a frameshift alignment paradigm, B-SOiD overcomes previous temporal resolution barriers. Using only a single, off-the-shelf camera, B-SOiD provides categories of sub-action for trained behaviors and kinematic measures of individual limb trajectories in any animal model. These behavioral and kinematic measures are difficult but critical to obtain, particularly in the study of rodent and other models of pain, OCD, and movement disorders.},

DLC2Action integrates multiple state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, optimized for action segmentation and supports self-supervised learning (SSL) to leverage unlabeled data, boosting performance with limited labeled datasets. Its robust implementation enables efficient hyperparameter optimization, customizable feature extraction, and data handling. We also standardized eight benchmarks and evaluated DLC2Action on five animal behavior datasets, which comprise common behavioral tests in neuroscience, and four human datasets. Overall these datasets span a wide range of contexts from standard laboratory studies to naturalistic cooking. DLC2Action reached strong performance across those benchmarks. To further showcase the tool's versatility, we applied it to Atari gameplay data and found that in certain games the players' eye movements consistently predict their button presses across different subjects. Furthermore, DLC2Action features an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) for streamlined behavior annotation, active learning, and assessment of model predictions. Diverse pose, video, and annotation formats are supported. Lastly, DLC2Action is modular and thus designed for extensibility, allowing users to integrate new models, dataset features, and methods. The code and benchmarks are available at: https://github.com/amathislab/DLC2action},

  abstract = {Spontaneous mouse behavior is composed from repeatedly used modules of movement (e.g., rearing, running or grooming) that are flexibly placed into sequences whose content evolves over time. By identifying behavioral modules and the order in which they are expressed, researchers can gain insight into the effect of drugs, genes, context, sensory stimuli and neural activity on natural behavior. Here we present a protocol for performing Motion Sequencing (MoSeq), an ethologically inspired method that uses three-dimensional machine vision and unsupervised machine learning to decompose spontaneous mouse behavior into a series of elemental modules called `syllables'. This protocol is based upon a MoSeq pipeline that includes modules for depth video acquisition, data preprocessing and modeling, as well as a standardized set of visualization tools. Users are provided with instructions and code for building a MoSeq imaging rig and acquiring three-dimensional video of spontaneous mouse behavior for submission to the modeling framework; the outputs of this protocol include syllable labels for each frame of the video data as well as summary plots describing how often each syllable was used and how syllables transitioned from one to the other. In addition, we provide instructions for analyzing and visualizing the outputs of keypoint-MoSeq, a recently developed variant of MoSeq that can identify behavioral motifs from keypoints identified from standard (rather than depth) video. This protocol and the accompanying pipeline significantly lower the bar for users without extensive computational ethology experience to adopt this unsupervised, data-driven approach to characterize mouse behavior.},

To enhance the modeling of three striking characteristics of human actions, including the position prior, the boundary ambiguity, and the relational dependency, we devise a unified masking strategy for the conditioning inputs in our framework. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, i.e., GTEA, 50Salads, and Breakfast, are performed and the proposed method achieves superior or comparable results to state-of-the-art methods, showing the effectiveness of a generative approach for action segmentation.},

Recent advances in markerless pose estimation enable the visualization of high-dimensional spatiotemporal behavioral dynamics of animal motion. However, robust and reliable technical approaches are needed to uncover underlying structure in these data and to segment behavior into discrete hierarchically organized motifs. Here, we present an unsupervised probabilistic deep learning framework that identifies behavioral structure from deep variational embeddings of animal motion (VAME). By using a mouse model of beta amyloidosis as a use case, we show that VAME not only identifies discrete behavioral motifs, but also captures a hierarchical representation of the motif's usage. The approach allows for the grouping of motifs into communities and the detection of differences in community-specific motif usage of individual mouse cohorts that were undetectable by human visual observation. Thus, we present a robust approach for the segmentation of animal motion that is applicable to a wide range of experimental setups, models and conditions without requiring supervised or a-priori human interference.},

The expansion of open-source tools for video acquisition and analysis has led to new experimental approaches to understand behavior.

Although striatal circuits have been implicated in action selection and implementation, the neural mechanisms that compose behavior in unrestrained animals are not well understood. Here, we record bulk and cellular neural activity in the direct and indirect pathways of dorsolateral striatum (DLS) as mice spontaneously express action sequences. These experiments reveal that DLS neurons systematically encode information about the identity and ordering of sub-second 3D behavioral motifs; this encoding is facilitated by fast-timescale decorrelations between the direct and indirect pathways. Furthermore, lesioning the DLS prevents appropriate sequence assembly during exploratory or odor-evoked behaviors. By characterizing naturalistic behavior at neural timescales, these experiments identify a code for elemental 3D pose dynamics built from complementary pathway dynamics, support a role for DLS in constructing meaningful behavioral sequences, and suggest models for how actions are sculpted over time.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

We recently introduced an open-source toolbox called DeepLabCut that builds on a state-of-the-art human pose-estimation algorithm to allow a user to train a deep neural network with limited training data to precisely track user-defined features that match human labeling accuracy. Here, we provide an updated toolbox, developed as a Python package, that includes new features such as graphical user interfaces (GUIs), performance improvements, and active-learning-based network refinement. We provide a step-by-step procedure for using DeepLabCut that guides the user in creating a tailored, reusable analysis pipeline with a graphical processing unit (GPU) in 1--12 h (depending on frame size). Additionally, we provide Docker environments and Jupyter Notebooks that can be run on cloud resources such as Google Colaboratory.},

To address the spike-sorting problem, we have been openly developing the Kilosort framework. Here we describe the various algorithmic steps introduced in different versions of Kilosort. We also report the development of Kilosort4, a version with substantially improved performance due to clustering algorithms inspired by graph-based approaches. To test the performance of Kilosort, we developed a realistic simulation framework that uses densely sampled electrical fields from real experiments to generate nonstationary spike waveforms and realistic noise. We found that nearly all versions of Kilosort outperformed other algorithms on a variety of simulated conditions and that Kilosort4 performed best in all cases, correctly identifying even neurons with low amplitudes and small spatial extents in high drift conditions.},

For the task of temporal action segmentation, we propose an encoder-decoder style architecture named C2F-TCN featuring a ``coarse-to-fine'' ensemble of decoder outputs. The C2F-TCN framework is enhanced with a novel model agnostic temporal feature augmentation strategy formed by the computationally inexpensive strategy of the stochastic max-pooling of segments. It produces more accurate and well-calibrated supervised results on three benchmark action segmentation datasets. We show that the architecture is flexible for both supervised and representation learning. In line with this, we present a novel unsupervised way to learn frame-wise representation from C2F-TCN. Our unsupervised learning approach hinges on the clustering capabilities of the input features and the formation of multi-resolution features from the decoder's implicit structure. Further, we provide first semi-supervised temporal action segmentation results by merging representation learning with conventional supervised learning. Our semi-supervised learning scheme, called ``Iterative-Contrastive-Classify (ICC)'', progressively improves in performance with more labeled data.

  abstract = {This paper provides a pair similarity optimization viewpoint on deep feature learning, aiming to maximize the within-class similarity sp and minimize the between-class similarity sn. We find a majority of loss functions, including the triplet loss and the softmax cross-entropy loss, embed sn and sp into similarity pairs and seek to reduce (sn - sp). Such an optimization manner is inflexible, because the penalty strength on every single similarity score is restricted to be equal. Our intuition is that if a similarity score deviates far from the optimum, it should be emphasized. To this end, we simply re-weight each similarity to highlight the less-optimized similarity scores. It results in a Circle loss, which is named due to its circular decision boundary. The Circle loss has a unified formula for two elemental deep feature learning paradigms, i.e., learning with class-level labels and pair-wise labels. Analytically, we show that the Circle loss offers a more flexible optimization approach towards a more definite convergence target, compared with the loss functions optimizing (sn - sp). Experimentally, we demonstrate the superiority of the Circle loss on a variety of deep feature learning tasks. On face recognition, person re-identification, as well as several finegrained image retrieval datasets, the achieved performance is on par with the state of the art.},

We present a multi-agent dataset from behavioral neuroscience, the Caltech Mouse Social Interactions (CalMS21) Dataset. Our dataset consists of trajectory data of social interactions, recorded from videos of freely behaving mice in a standard resident-intruder assay. To help accelerate behavioral studies, the CalMS21 dataset provides benchmarks to evaluate the performance of automated behavior classification methods in three settings: (1) for training on large behavioral datasets all annotated by a single annotator, (2) for style transfer to learn inter-annotator differences in behavior definitions, and (3) for learning of new behaviors of interest given limited training data. The dataset consists of 6 million frames of unlabeled tracked poses of interacting mice, as well as over 1 million frames with tracked poses and corresponding frame-level behavior annotations. The challenge of our dataset is to be able to classify behaviors accurately using both labeled and unlabeled tracking data, as well as being able to generalize to new settings.},

  abstract = {To identify and extract naturalistic behavior, two methods have become popular: supervised and unsupervised. Each approach carries its own strengths and weaknesses (for example, user bias, training cost, complexity and action discovery), which the user must consider in their decision. Here, an active-learning platform, A-SOiD, blends these strengths, and in doing so, overcomes several of their inherent drawbacks. A-SOiD iteratively learns user-defined groups with a fraction of the usual training data, while attaining expansive classification through directed unsupervised classification. In socially interacting mice, A-SOiD outperformed standard methods despite requiring 85\% less training data. Additionally, it isolated ethologically distinct mouse interactions via unsupervised classification. We observed similar performance and efficiency using nonhuman primate and human three-dimensional pose data. In both cases, the transparency in A-SOiD's cluster definitions revealed the defining features of the supervised classification through a game-theoretic approach. To facilitate use, A-SOiD comes as an intuitive, open-source interface for efficient segmentation of user-defined behaviors and discovered sub-actions.},

Here, we provide an overview of the most salient regularities that shape biological motion, examine the role of these invariants in recognizing others' actions, and speculate that anchoring socially-relevant perceptual decisions to such kinematic invariants provides a key computational advantage for inferring conspecifics' goals and intentions.},

By stabilizing these clusters through machine learning, we ensure data transferability, while dimensionality reduction techniques facilitate detailed analysis of individual animals. We provide a large dataset of 771 behavior recordings of freely moving mice---including stress exposures, pharmacological and brain circuit interventions---to identify hidden treatment effects, reveal subtle variations on the level of individual animals and detect brain processes underlying specific interventions.

First, we devise a new cascading paradigm, called Stage Cascade, to enable our model to have adaptive receptive fields and more confident predictions for ambiguous frames. Second, we design a general and principled smoothing operation, termed as local barrier pooling, to aggregate local predictions by leveraging semantic boundary information. Moreover, these two components can be jointly fine-tuned in an end-to-end manner. We perform experiments on three challenging datasets: 50Salads, GTEA and Breakfast dataset, demonstrating that our framework significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods.

However, deep convolution layers cause a loss of local information required for frame recognition. To solve the above problem, a new encoder-decoder structure is proposed in this paper, called Cross-Enhancement Transformer. Our approach can be effective learning of temporal structure representation with interactive self-attention mechanism and concatenate each layer convolutional feature maps in encoder with a set of features in decoder produced via self-attention. Therefore, local and global information are excavated in a series of frame actions simultaneously. In addition, a new loss function is proposed to enhance the training process whick can penalize over-segmentation errors. Experiments show that our framework performs state-of-the-art on three challenging datasets: 50Salads, Georgia Tech Egocentric Activities and the Breakfast dataset.

  abstract = {Despite the steady progress in video analysis led by the adoption of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the relative improvement has been less drastic as that in 2D static image classification. Three main challenges exist including spatial (image) feature representation, temporal information representation, and model/computation complexity. It was recently shown by Carreira and Zisserman that 3D CNNs, inflated from 2D networks and pretrained on ImageNet, could be a promising way for spatial and temporal representation learning. However, as for model/computation complexity, 3D CNNs are much more expensive than 2D CNNs and prone to overfit. We seek a balance between speed and accuracy by building an effective and efficient video classification system through systematic exploration of critical network design choices. In particular, we show that it is possible to replace many of the 3D convolutions by low-cost 2D convolutions. Rather surprisingly, best result (in both speed and accuracy) is achieved when replacing the 3D convolutions at the bottom of the network, suggesting that temporal representation learning on high-level semantic features is more useful. Our conclusion generalizes to datasets with very different properties. When combined with several other cost-effective designs including separable spatial/temporal convolution and feature gating, our system results in an effective video classification system that that produces very competitive results on several action classification benchmarks (Kinetics, Something-something, UCF101 and HMDB), as well as two action detection (localization) benchmarks (JHMDB and UCF101-24).},

  abstract = {Algorithms for the action segmentation task typically use temporal models to predict what action is occurring at each frame for a minute-long daily activity. Recent studies have shown the potential of Transformer in modeling the relations among elements in sequential data. However, there are several major concerns when directly applying the Transformer to the action segmentation task, such as the lack of inductive biases with small training sets, the deficit in processing long input sequence, and the limitation of the decoder architecture to utilize temporal relations among multiple action segments to refine the initial predictions. To address these concerns, we design an efficient Transformer-based model for action segmentation task, named ASFormer, with three distinctive characteristics: (i) We explicitly bring in the local connectivity inductive priors because of the high locality of features. It constrains the hypothesis space within a reliable scope, and is beneficial for the action segmentation task to learn a proper target function with small training sets. (ii) We apply a pre-defined hierarchical representation pattern that efficiently handles long input sequences. (iii) We carefully design the decoder to refine the initial predictions from the encoder. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that effectiveness of our methods.
